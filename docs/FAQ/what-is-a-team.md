# What is a Team?

Code Capsules provides Teams for collaborative development. Multiple members may belong to a team.

A Team may contain multiple [Spaces](https://codecapsules.io/docs/FAQ/what-is-a-space/) and [Capsules](https://codecapsules.io/docs/FAQ/what-is-a-capsule/). Members of the Team can interact with these Spaces and Capsules.  

Furthermore, Teams handle the payment for all of its Capsules. You set up a payment method for the entire Team (a credit card), and Code Capsules charges that payment method appropriately.
