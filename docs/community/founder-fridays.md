# Founder Fridays

![Founder Fridays](../assets/community/founder-fridays.jpg)

**Founder Fridays are weekly Zoom calls happening every Friday at 13:00 - 14:00 SAST. Anyone is welcome!**

This is an opportunity to network and share your product with fellow-creators. It is also an useful opportunity to get feedback on the product itself, the underlying business or just have a set weekly timeslot to keep yourself accountable in terms of making progress during the week. This is a great resource for all types of product owners, startup leads or just anyone hacking on personal products. In addition, it is also open to the curious that simply want to see how products get built and how decisions are made around product design. 

If you are interested in attending merely submit your name and email via the following form: https://forms.gle/NLymSw5NVsLshHDX8
