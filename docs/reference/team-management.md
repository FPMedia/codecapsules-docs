# Team Management

A [Team](../../FAQ/what-is-a-team/) is a group of developers who share access to the same [Spaces](../../FAQ/what-is-a-space/) and [Capsules](../../FAQ/what-is-a-capsule/) in order to make collaborative development easier. This guide explores the team management options available to you with Code Capsules.

## Creating Teams

You can create as many teams as you need on Code Capsules. The name of your current Team will be displayed in the top navigation bar, to the right of the Code Capsules logo. To create a new Team, click on the down arrow next to your current Team name.

Click on the "Create New Team" option in the dropdown menu, and fill in your Team name in the screen that slides in from the right. Confirm your changes by clicking "I Like It".

## Adding Team Repos

Code Capsules connects to GitHub to deploy applications on its platform. Before you can deploy an application, you need to give Code Capsules permission to read the repository on your GitHub account you want to deploy from.

### Adding a Repository to a Team 

If you've already linked your Code Capsules account to GitHub, you'll be asked which repos to add to your Team. Click "Add" next to the repos you wish to add to your Team, then click "Confirm".

### Linking to GitHub

If you haven't yet linked GitHub to your Code Capsules account, you'll be asked to do so now. Click "Install GitHub".

![Edit Team Repos](../assets/reference/team-management/edit-team-repos-no-git.png)

Select your GitHub username, and do the following in the dialog box that appears:

1. Select "Only Select Repositories".
2. Choose the GitHub repository you want to deploy from.
3. Press "Install & Authorize".

### Editing Team Repos

If you need to edit the Team Repos later, select "Team Settings" in the top navigation bar to switch to the "Team Settings" tab.

Click on the "Modify" button in the "Team Repos" section, and an “Edit Team Repos” dialog will slide in from the right. Click “Add” next to the repo you wish to deploy from, and then “Confirm”.

All the Spaces in your Team will now have access to this repo.

## Team Billing 

Next you'll be asked to enter your Team billing information. You can do so now, or skip this step if you wish to do it later.

## Inviting Team Members

The final step in creating a Team is to invite members to it. Enter your prospective team members' email addresses in the text field and click "Invite Team Members" to send your invitation.

Your Team is now ready to begin collaborating.
